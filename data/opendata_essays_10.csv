So you--no matter what situation you're coming out of, no matter what neighborhood you're from--you have no excuse.'""""\n\nMoctar Teyeb has begun to give speeches exposing North African slavery. Teyeb is often compared to Frederick Douglas, and he lives only 15 blocks from Wings Academy. We would like to invite him to speak to the 10th graders who have read his story.\n""",,,,,
