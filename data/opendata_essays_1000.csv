MY REFLECTIONS: Feeding us all and getting everyone to and from the theatre safely are the largest costs. I love this project for so many reasons.  A few that come to mind are: the geographic exchange – people who live in the Bronx coming downtown for the first time and a whole a new world opening up.  Artists who've never been to the Bronx coming and experiencing its beauty.  Young men working in a womyn run theatre. NADIA'S REFLECTIONS: I'm 17 years old and I'm the choreographer of the High Status Dancers.  I was also in the show last year. I read poems and played in a game of freeze.

The implementation of this art program is the direct result of our staff's dedication to bringing the arts into our school.   At various times, this has been a struggle.

That is why I am asking that you donate some very useful products to our school.  \n\n<P>\n\nMy curriculum for this year is a thematic approach to learning Art History and includes an art project for each unit.  These projects will, over the course of the year, vary greatly in relation to the unit of which they are a part.  For example, in a unit on self-exploration that includes interdisciplinary work with the English Department, we will be studying self-portraiture, especially in Frida Kahlo's work, and then creating self-portraits like hers.  In another unit, we will study the theme of isolation in Edward Hopper's paintings and doing a photography project to convey isolation.  There are few things more expressive and intimate in education than a student's conception of art.\n\n<P>\n\nThe products that I have requested will be used in these kinds of different projects throughout the year as they supplement the supplies that are in the budget.  As for the slide projector, I cannot think of a more important piece of equipment for an Art History class.  All of the students need to be able to view large reproductions of artworks in order to be comfortable with the images as well as push the boundaries of their own imaginations.  There is certainly a difference between a lifelike sculpture and a 3” by 4” picture.  \n\n<P>\n\nThe poverty that my students experience at home should not be replicated in their education.  I want to give these students an experience that is not limited by the monetary confines of our school in hopes that it will enrich their appreciation of art, themselves and deepen their understanding of how the arts are a part of all of our lives.

A great majority of the students receive free or reduced price lunches.  <p>I am teaching a cycle-length class (ending early November) on World revolutions, focusing in on the causes/events/results of the French, Russian and Chinese Revolutions. The course is designed to satisfy a """"Global Theme"""" section of our Social Studies Portfolio, which we require upon a student's graduation.  <p>I would like to take my students on a field trip to Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum.  This would be a simple trip, as we could easily walk up to 42nd Street ourselves.  Madame Tussaud was herself a figure during the French Revolutionary period and the Museum contains images of a guillotine and prominent figures of that era.   <p>I think that the students would be thrilled to see such an exhibit and I am quite certain that this trip would prompt a lively discussion of a variety of issues from that time period as well as issues current today (i.e. the death penalty). The entire class of 25 would benefit enormously and consider this an extra special 'treat' during these rough days....when school trips, themselves, have already been cancelled or 're-thought' due to the tragedy at the World Trade Center. The class is made up of lively, eager, motivated students who would be quite happy to share their thoughts/reflections after such a trip in written form.""",,,,,

We will begin with images and poetry/memoirs about NYC, and then develop ideas from there.  Students are be able to choose their own direction, but each will be expressing his or her feelings about being a young person in New York, either as a native New Yorker or as a recent arrival. This subject is especially important after the terror attack. <p>Urban Academy encourages each student to ask probing questions, to be responsible for his or her learning, to debate and discuss, to read widely and write thoughtfully.  Word and Image reflects these educational values in asking students reflect on their lives as young New Yorkers.<p>We'll need digital cameras to document scenes from students' neighborhoods, including places where they grew up, their neighbors, and other scenes that students feel capture their vision of NY. We will also visit NY art institutions and galleries to learn about New York artists and their interpretations of the city. The images will later become inspirations for student writing:  poems as well as memoirs and essays.<p>We will also need artistic papers for mounting their writing and images, and heavier papers to create covers for their final collections (books).  Our hope is to exhibit all their books at the end of the term in the art gallery located in the Julia Richman Education Complex.  We'd love to have our donor attend the """"opening""""!""",,,,,

My students watched the World Trade Center burn and collaspe from our classroom windows.  Several studnets and staff members sat helplessly watching the destruction knowing that loved ones either worked in the buildings or nearby.  Students and staff now pass police and National Guardsmen checkpoints everyday coming and leaving the school.  We are catty corner from FDNY headquaters and the 911 operators offices.  The fire station one block away from the school lost four firefighters.  Everyday as we come and go, we are reminded of the tragedy and its on going signficance.\n\nScience Skills Center High School is a New Vision school founded to motivate and prepare average minority students to succeed in college.  Despite a large ratio of students entitled to free lunches, we have been very successful. Many of former students come back to visit and give motivational speeches to students now attending the school.\n\nEven before the World Trade Center collaspe, I wanted these video series for my students.  I teach United States History and Government and Participation in Government.  The """"Who Built America"""" videos tell the dramatic story of how everyday Americans of all backgrounds built this country; how everyone's life can have a heroic affect on America's future.  These films are suitable not only for the classroom, but also can be used in assemblies and for after school activities.

We try to prepare the student for these exams with very limited resources. \n\nA few years ago I took a teachers class entitled “When Coal Was King.” We went on a trip to the Lackawanna Coal Mine and Steamtown USA in Pennsylvania. The course discussed the history of coal in America, first from a geological and then from an economic point of view. The bus left the city at 8am. Once the bus got on the highway, we had class on the bus, which included handouts. The instructor taught for about one hour then proceeded to show a movie on coal mining. We arrived at the mines about 11:30am. We were taken 300 feet underground, where we spent the next hour and half exploring the mines. Our guide spoke about many topics, for example (1)child labor- children started working in the mines at five and six year old; (2) animal labor- they took 60,000 mules out of a mine during a strike; (3) strikes, and labor unions- the mines were one of the most dangerous jobs in America, they were forced to unionize and strike many times over. All of these topics are covered in my Economics class. After the visit to the coal mine we visited Steamtown USA to see how the raw material was used. We also discussed how coal was changed into steam and steam used by mainline steam-engines trains. This is relevant since steam engines built this country. \n\nI would like to duplicate this trip for our students (annually). It would have two major benefits for our students, one from a Social Studies (Economics) point of view and secondly, from an Earth Science (Geological) point of view. From the time the bus leaves the school that time would be used as class time. The Science Department (William Panaram PhD) would teach anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes, on the formation of anthracite coal and the necessary conditions associated with its formation of rock. Rock structure will also be discussed. Also the science department would lecture on steam and steam power. At Steamtown USA they have train cut outs, so that students would be able to look at the inside of an engine. Then the Social Studies Department would teach for the same amount of time, on the labor union movement, strikes and the economics of coal. The remainder of the trip to Pennsylvania would be used to show a movie on entitled “Matewan.” This is a film about miners trying to unionize the mines.\n""","""I am a Social Studies - Economics teacher at Bronx Outreach High School, one of  New York Cities alternative public schools.

Our guide spoke about many topics, for example (1)child labor- children started working in the mines at five and six year old; (2) animal labor- they took 60,000 mules out of a mine during a strike; (3) strikes, and labor unions- the mines were one of the most dangerous jobs in America, they were forced to unionize and strike many times over. All of these topics are covered in my Economics class. After the visit to the coal mine we visited Steamtown USA to see how the raw material was used. We also discussed how coal was changed into steam and steam used by mainline steam-engines trains. This is relevant since steam engines built this country. \n\nI would like to duplicate this trip for our students (annually). It would have two major benefits for our students, one from a Social Studies (Economics) point of view and secondly, from an Earth Science (Geological) point of view. From the time the bus leaves the school that time would be used as class time. The Science Department (William Panaram PhD) would teach anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes, on the formation of anthracite coal and the necessary conditions associated with its formation of rock. Rock structure will also be discussed. Also the science department would lecture on steam and steam power. At Steamtown USA they have train cut outs, so that students would be able to look at the inside of an engine. Then the Social Studies Department would teach for the same amount of time, on the labor union movement, strikes and the economics of coal. The remainder of the trip to Pennsylvania would be used to show a movie on entitled “Matewan.” This is a film about miners trying to unionize the mines.\n""",,,,,

I would like to place this computer in the writing center of our workshop.  \n\nI know that it doesn't seem like one computer would make a big difference in a classroom of 30 students, but you have no idea what changes have occured in my classroom because of DonorsChoose.   My room has gone from a cold, unwelcoming room to a colorful, comfortable room in which my students spend most of their waking hours.  This computer would only increase the difference DonorsChoose has made, giving my children a chance to publish their hard work, and to use tutoring or enrichment software.  At this time, we are not allowed to even use the computers in the one computer lab in the school, or the computers in the library.  \n\nFinally, I chose a laptop because I want my students to be able to use this computer in different areas of the classroom, for instance the writing center or the classroom library.  I like my children to be comfortable when they work.\n\nThis computer would not only benefit me and my class, but also all of the other fifth grade teachers and students. We are all very close and share all of our resources.\n\nPlease help me, the 30 children in my class presently, and the other children in my future classes by funding this computer. It will be well loved and well cared for, as well as well used.\n\nThank you.\n""",,,,,

I could ask others - friends, mentors, and teachers who are unable to visit during the school day - to watch, observe and critique my lessons.  I want to be the best teacher I can for my students.  The ability to record and later review lessons would help me to improve.\nA video camera would be a huge asset to learning and teaching in my classroom.""",,,,,

The disposable cameras would give them an opportunity to go into their communities and homes and collect images that reflect who and what has formed their behavior and thinking.  As a result, the students' work will come alive in a more creative form. Having an alternative medium in which to express their ideas will also take some pressure off those who are not strong writers while giving all students an experiential way to express their thinking.   The photos will motivate students to think more critically about what has influenced their own identities.  This project will also allow students to recognize what they are proud of in their identities and consider what they might want to change.  If they increase this awareness they can understand and accept themselves and others, thereby helping to prevent future prejudice in their communities.  Finally, this project will help students recognize how culture is developed in their own lives and therefore improve the understanding of its' development throughout the world and through history.<p>\n\n\n\nThe photo journals will be displayed in each student's portfolio, and if they choose, in their graduation portfolio as well.\n\n \n\n""",,,,,

The carpet area becomes the most critical place that classroom community begins. It's where I get to know my students and they begin to feel safe enough to get to know me and each other. Once safety has been established, the carpet area becomes the center of all learning and sharing that takes place for the rest of the year.\n\nWe meet on our carpet at the start of each day to say good morning, share news, learn about calendars and seasons, math place values and telling time. We have reading instruction in small groups on our carpet, as well as candlelight storytime and parent visits. And we never hesitate to move a math or science lesson (textbooks, magnifying glasses, counting blocks and all!) over to the carpet when more intimate instruction can really personalize an activity. \n\nNeedless to say, the carpet area is truly the heart and soul of my classroom, and our current carpet has seen countless years of similar wear and tear. A new colorful, child-friendly carpet would add priceless """"magic"""" to our carpet time and excite my students endlessly. This carpet would be an inviting place for all my students in the future! \n\n\n\n""",,,,,

Everyday for thirty minutes my classroom is now converted into an enormous fort, children's coats hanging from desks - small feet sticking out from underneath, students sprawled across the window sills and tucked away in closets.  It is a time when they get to feel completely safe and at home in our classroom. Although my students create """"safe"""" study spaces for themselves with simply their coats, I would love to be able to provide them with a few luxuries that they deserve. That is why I am attempting to get them bean bag chairs. \n\n\n\nThe beanbag chairs will provide them with a comfortable reading spot to sink into their books. We will rotate their use so that all of my students will be provided with an comfy alternative to the floor, encouraging their reading habits. \n\n\n\nI am amazed at how my children constantly do so much with so little. I am astounded at their desire to learn despite the lack of material incentives that i can give them. Currently 85% of P.S. 92's students are reading below grade level. It is imperative that they learn to love to read so that they may become readers.  Thank you so much for you time and consideration! \n\n""",,,,,

They are crammed on like sardines.  Inevitably, the last student to come to the rug is standing, teary eyed, saying, """"but there's no more space."""" I have the class squish a little more, but there still really isn't room.  It is very hard for a five year old to be a good listener and learner with someone sitting almost on their lap.  Instead of paying attention to our story or lesson, the students are distracted by who's squishing them or poking them.  With a rug that will fit them all, my students will have their own personal space to learn. <p> \n\n\n\nIn addition, I've seen other early childhood classrooms that are large and spacious and very child friendly.  Many times I think that my classroom does not have that look or feel.  I want my class to be a place that children are comfortable and where they enjoy coming.  Giving my students a place in the room that is colorful and friendly, and most importantly, where they know there is always room for them, will help make my classroom a place that children want to be, and a place they feel is their own.<p>\n\n\n\nI have chosen this specific rug because it has letters and pictures that promote letter regonition and early reading skills.  In addition, it has numbers to 26 to promote number recognition.  These are very important skills for all the Kindergarteners in my class. Please help me make space for everyone in K-003! <p>""",,,,,

We will be going from April 20th -21st.  \n\nAt Urban Academy we have a college-oriented curriculum that encourages students to explore and discuss ideas, conduct research and debate and evaluate information.  Part of the way we do this is to provide the students with as many different experiences and field trips as possible.\n\nOur law curriculum is an important instrument in honing students' critical thinking skills.  Throughout the semester, students will read actual cases, write briefs and conduct oral arguments, serving as both attorneys and judges.  The objective is for them to learn how constitutional law develops through judicial decisions and stare decisis, how to develop sound legal reasoning, and acquire some knowledge of concepts of individual rights.\n\nSeeing the Court in action will be invaluable for the class.  We will\nactually read about and discuss the cases being argued beforehand and also hope to meet with one of Justice Kennedy's current law clerks after the argument.

The student population is mostly composed of blacks and hispanics from low income families.

The district has no funds for library furniture which we need desperately.  We have a tired and squeeky paperback rack, which looks like the Leaning Tower of Piza, and can hold no more.  We would like a paperback rack that can accommodate more books, more attractively.  We also need more regular shelving because we've run out of space and because some of our existing shelves came crashing down!\n\nIt would be great to display our books attractively and and get our students reading. Although we don't have a specific date that we need them by, the sooner the better.  I'd like to thank you in advance and hope that someone hears our cry.""",,,,,

Many of my students have low reading skills (if any at all) due to the hardships and life experiences that kept them away from academia in their home countries.

My students generally lack an understanding of scientific equipment due to the nature of the education systems from their country of origin.  Yet, they are tested on the same plane as others and justifiably so.  For they need the same skills in order to become accomplished professionals in a country were education is a necessity.  My students are first generation students, but I want them to have the success of a second generation.  This I have attempted to provide on my own by purchasing what I can to complete their education.  \n\nUnfortunately, all resources are finite and a complete grasp of certain academic areas cannot be accomplished without the proper materials.  Triple beam scales will aid in completing their education and preparing them for a cumulative exam that will test their comprehension in vital areas of science.

I am a fifth and sixth grade bilingual teacher at I.S. 125 in the Bronx. Approximately 95% of the students in my school qualify for reduced or free lunch.  100% of my students receive free lunch. My class this year will be comprised of about 28 English language learning/bilingual students most of whose families have immigrated to the United States in search of a better life for their families.  Because of their familial and economic circumstances and the efforts their families have made to be in this country, my students are constantly eager to learn and advance in their studies.  Unfortunately the lack of special attention and tools for learning available to my students often makes it difficult to take full advantage of my students' drive and perseverance. \n\nI am incredibly dedicated and passionate about my work and constantly search above and beyond for tools and resources so that my students have an equal opportunity to an excellent education and an excellent future. Last year, I encountered several challenges as a first year bilingual teacher because of the severe lack of resources available to my students as native Spanish speakers.  Despite these conditions, my students achieved more than anyone could've imagined and felt proud of what they had proven to themselves.  This year, I want to make sure my students have ALL they need to be academically successful both by their own measurement and by the measurement of State and local education.  I do not want my students to be denied their right to an excellent and equal education.\n\nAs we all know, reading is perhaps the most important component of any learners life.  Specifically, in the lives of my bilingual students, reading is more than just a part of school - it means having true exposure to the world of reading for the first time, learning a new language, developing and sustaining a first language and often - learning how to read all together.  Many of my students have low reading skills (if any at all) due to the hardships and life experiences that kept them away from academia in their home countries. Learning to read for my students means more than just taking a standardized test.  It means learning why reading is important, its significant role in learning a second language and the beauty of sustaining and developing their first.  \n\nThis summer I took Lucy Calkins' """"The Art of Teaching Reading"""" as a Columbia University Teacher's College graduate student. In this course I was taught and trained the principals of one of the top and internationally renowned reading and writing projects in the field.  This proposal is one of nine all linked to implementing Lucy Calkins' Reading Workshop in my classroom next year (and for years to come in my work with bilingual students). The fundamental thought of this program is to teach students HOW to read, WHY to read and to create life-long learners and readers.  Reader's workshop takes place every day for a minimum of 50- 70 minutes of the day and utilizes coursework across all subject areas to boost and build the students as readers.  In this program, the teacher is not the """"lecturer"""" in front of the classroom but a coach that guides the team and each individual player towards their best.

""","""Hello! I am a fifth and sixth grade bilingual teacher at I.S. 125 in the Bronx. Approximately 95% of the students in my school qualify for reduced or free lunch.  100% of my students receive free lunch. My class this year will be comprised of about 28 English language learning/bilingual students most of whose families have immigrated to the United States in search of a better life for their families.  Because of their familial and economic circumstances and the efforts their families have made to be in this country, my students are constantly eager to learn and advance in their studies.  Unfortunately the lack of special attention and tools for learning available to my students often makes it difficult to take full advantage of my students' drive and perseverance. \n\nI am incredibly dedicated and passionate about my work and constantly search above and beyond for tools and resources so that my students have an equal opportunity to an excellent education and an excellent future. Last year, I encountered several challenges as a first year bilingual teacher because of the severe lack of resources available to my students as native Spanish speakers.  Despite these conditions, my students achieved more than anyone could've imagined and felt proud of what they had proven to themselves.  This year, I want to make sure my students have ALL they need to be academically successful both by their own measurement and by the measurement of State and local education.  I do not want my students to be denied their right to an excellent and equal education.\n\nAs we all know, reading is perhaps the most important component of any learners life.  Specifically, in the lives of my bilingual students, reading is more than just a part of school - it means having true exposure to the world of reading for the first time, learning a new language, developing and sustaining a first language and often - learning how to read all together.  Many of my students have low reading skills (if any at all) due to the hardships and life experiences that kept them away from academia in their home countries. Learning to read for my students means more than just taking a standardized test.  It means learning why reading is important, its significant role in learning a second language and the beauty of sustaining and developing their first.  \n\nThis summer I took Lucy Calkins' """"The Art of Teaching Reading"""" as a Columbia University Teacher's College graduate student. In this course I was taught and trained the principals of one of the top and internationally renowned reading and writing projects in the field.  This proposal is one of nine all linked to implementing Lucy Calkins' Reading Workshop in my classroom next year (and for years to come in my work with bilingual students). The fundamental thought of this program is to teach students HOW to read, WHY to read and to create life-long learners and readers.  Reader's workshop takes place every day for a minimum of 50- 70 minutes of the day and utilizes coursework across all subject areas to boost and build the students as readers.  In this program, the teacher is not the """"lecturer"""" in front of the classroom but a coach that guides the team and each individual player towards their best.  I provide the readers with the tools to think critically, read critically and assess critically all while enjoying reading. In order to do this students need to have access to a large quantity (at least 15 books per student) and a wide array (all genres) of literature.  This proposal specifically requests all sorts of folklore, poetry, art and drama books in Spanish. It is one of 9 other proposals that together can make this project a reality in my classroom.

At P162, all the students (Grades K-8) receive free breakfast and lunch.  \n\n     As occupational therapists, we are trained to treat the underlying deficits that impair one to learn and develop the basic skills of handwriting.  This unique program, which was developed by an occupational therapist, does just that.  Many teachers in other schools have used this program sucessfully around the country.\n\n     We have been given approval to implement this program with a kindergarten class this summer.  These students are in desperate need of immediate attention due to their developmental delays.  These delays in basic skills keep them from advancing to the next level in school. \n\n      Our pilot program is being carried out in a group setting within the classroom.  Each session starts with a gross motor warm up (movement enables readiness for seatwork),  then students learn to build letters using wood pieces (gives tactile, visual, and spatial cues to letters) before moving to individual slate chalkboards (wood framed board helps with letter orientation), and finally to individual workbooks (which mimic wood pieces and slates).

At P162, all the students (Grades K-8) receive free breakfast and lunch.  \n\n     As occupational therapists, we are trained to treat the underlying deficits that impair one to learn and develop the basic skills of handwriting.  This unique program, which was developed by an occupational therapist, does just that.  Many teachers in other schools have used this program sucessfully around the country.\n\n     We have been given approval to implement this program with a kindergarten class this summer.  These students are in desperate need of immediate attention due to their developmental delays.  These delays in basic skills keep them from advancing to the next level in school. \n\n      Our pilot program is being carried out in a group setting within the classroom.  Each session starts with a gross motor warm up (movement enables readiness for seatwork),  then students learn to build letters using wood pieces (gives tactile, visual, and spatial cues to letters) before moving to individual slate chalkboards (wood framed board helps with letter orientation), and finally to individual workbooks (which mimic wood pieces and slates).  This program has been shown to make handwriting fun while increasing self-esteem, correcting bad habits (such as reversals), and providing a developmentally-appropriate foundation for successful handwriting.\n\n     At the present time, we have been working in this class and have been struggling with the few materials we purchased ourselves.

We will explore African-American History through novels, poetry, folktales, songs, myths, movies, and crafts. This unit will expand on our Social Studies curriculum, but through literature, bringing a richer understanding of this subject to my students.\n\nWe will be reading three books, """"Slave Dancer,"""" by Paula Fox, """"Speed of Light,"""" by Sibyl Rosen, and """"Leon's Story"""" (an autobiography) by Leon Tillage.  All are award-winning books, and I can say from experience excellent reads.  We will also be reading """"Freedom Summer,"""" and """"Following the Drinking Gourd.""""  \n\nAs well as reading these fiction and nonfiction books, we will also read narrative text, including excerpts from """"To Be A Slave,"""" and """"A Kid's Guide to African-American History.""""  Much of this narrative text will be in the form of Xerox copies kept in binders, which have been provided to us by a generous donor at DonorsChoose.\n\nWe will be engaging in some hands-on activities, such as making sandstone columns, such as those from Ethiopia, beaded necklaces, such as those which were traded for slaves, traditional cloth from Ghana, a slave medallion, and many other crafts.\n\nFinally we will be watching 2 movies, """"The Color Purple"""" and """"Corrina, Corrina."""" \n\nPlease fund this proposal and help my students become more aware of the rich history of African Americans.  This curriculum will benefit my entire class, as well as the 5 other fifth grade classes at my school this year.  Since I plan to use this curriculum every year, and share with any teacher who wishes, there is no way to count the number of students who will benefit form this donation.\n\nThe cost of 35 copies of """"Slave Dancer,"""" """"Speed of Light,"""" and """"Leon's Story"""" respectively, as well as a copy each of """"Freedom Summer,"""" """"Following the Drinking Gourd"""" and the videos """"The Color Purple"""" and """"Corrina, Corrina,"""" is $727, including shipping and disposable camera""",,,,,

The fundamental thought of this program is to teach students HOW to read, WHY to read and to create life-long learners and readers.  Reader's workshop takes place every day for a minimum of 50-70 minutes of the day and utilizes coursework across all subject areas to boost and build the students as readers.  In this program, the teacher is not the """"lecturer"""" in front of the classroom but a coach that guides the team and each individual player towards their best.  I provide the readers with the tools to think critically, read critically and assess critically all while enjoying reading. In order to do this students need to have access to a large quantity (at least 15 books per student) and a wide array (all genres) of literature.  This proposal specifically requests all sorts of series books in Spanish (including Anne of Green Gables, Beverly Clearly, and Little House on the Prairie) .

I also teach an after school computer club, Project TECH, for fourth and fifth graders which I started with two fellow teachers last year.  Although our school is under-resourced, we do have access to brand new technology:  a Dell computer lab, scanner, and printer.  I am writing to request funding that would allow Media Workshop, a non-profit organization, to help my Project TECH students and me publish a school digital newsletter that could be posted to PS 128's website. \n\nLast year, our goal for Project TECH was to produce a school newsletter entitled, """"The Voices of Audubon.""""  The newsletter would have different sections such as essays, poetry, book and movie reviews, interviews, and art.  The students would conduct interviews and learn to create articles in Word, as well as conduct surveys from which they would create graphs in Excel to be added to our newsletter.  \n\nWe accomplished our goal in the sense that students wrote numerous articles on topics such as the teacher strike, and the school budget cuts.  They also wrote articles profiling winners in many local contests such as the Women's History Month essay contest and the Ezra Jack Keats bookmaking competition.  Students interviewed the principal, vice-principals, teachers, the union leader, as well as fellow students before writing these articles.  They also conducted research and wrote numerous essays and created PowerPoint Presentations for Black History Month, Women's History Month, and Dominican Heritage Month.  Finally, they conducted school-wide polls and created graphs to show their findings in Excel.  Many students wrote persuasive essays to accompany the graphs as well. In our school we are lucky to have a computer network onto which all of the students' work is still saved.  However, try as we might, we were never able to successfully create a school newsletter in Microsoft Publisher.  We encountered many problems that we simply could not overcome: Microsoft Publisher is not a kid-friendly program, and we did not have the funds to run off copies of the newsletter for the entire school. (The teachers' participation in the club is completely voluntary).   \n\nThis year, since we have approximately ten fifth graders and ten fourth graders, the students could benefit from peer editing and peer help in general since the fifth graders have already been exposed to programs such as Excel, Word, and PowerPoint.  In the upcoming year, Project TECH students will also try their hand at editing since we will host school-wide writing contests and writing submissions giving all students, parents, and teachers at PS 128 a chance to publish in our newsletter.   \n\nMy main goal for this year is for students involved in Project TECH to feel some success for the hard work that they put into their research and their writing four hours per week after school.  Rather than frustration, I want students to feel the success of publication.  Therefore, my proposal is to have Media Workshop help Project TECH create a school digital newsletter.  We have the capability in our school; we just need someone to show us how to put it to work. I have spoken to a representative from Media Workshop already and she told me it would take approximately 8 after school sessions to accomplish our goal.  I, my fellow teachers, as well as my students will together learn how to publish the digital newsletter (no copies needed!)so that we can create all future magazines independently.  Not only will students benefit from honing their research/writing/interviewing/editing/computer skills, but they will also experience the pride and accomplishment of becoming published authors.    \n\nThe cost of publishing supplies (binders, sheet protectors, computer disks) and Media Workshops conducted by Donna Schnupp is $453, including shipping and disposable camera.""","""I am a Teach for America alumna teaching fourth grade at an under-resourced school, PS 128, in Washington Heights.

Satellite Academy in an alternative high school on the Lower Eastside that was one of the first alternative high schools in the country.  We have an excellent track record educating young people who have not been successful in traditional high schools.   Our student population is African-American and Hispanic.  All of our students receive free lunch and breakfast. Many of our female students are young mothers.  We have a daycare center on site to service them.\n\nIn this class, we use the Holocaust as a case study to discuss issues of race, prejudice, discrimination and obedience to authority. We ask students to examine their own behaviors and experiences to make connections between the history we study and their own lives.  Ultimately, our goal is for students to understand that they are history makers and the choices they make do make a difference.  We hope they make choices that make a better world.\n\nLast year, we got a generous donation from DonorsChoose to take our students for a day trip to Washington, D.C. primarily to visit the Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.  It was a very successful trip.  We had  many conversations afterwards about how to remember and honor human tragedies.  Students created their own memorials in clay and we set up a mini-museum in our art room for the rest of the school to visit.  Students from the class wrote meaning statements to help explain their works of art.  We would like the opportunity to do the same trip. We were surprised that  most of our students had never been out of New York State.

Satellite Academy in an alternative high school on the Lower Eastside that was one of the first alternative high schools in the country.  We have an excellent track record educating young people who have not been successful in traditional high schools.   Our student population is African-American and Hispanic.  All of our students receive free lunch and breakfast. Many of our female students are young mothers.  We have a daycare center on site to service them.\n\nIn this class, we use the Holocaust as a case study to discuss issues of race, prejudice, discrimination and obedience to authority. We ask students to examine their own behaviors and experiences to make connections between the history we study and their own lives.  Ultimately, our goal is for students to understand that they are history makers and the choices they make do make a difference.  We hope they make choices that make a better world.\n\nLast year, we got a generous donation from DonorsChoose to take our students for a day trip to Washington, D.C. primarily to visit the Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.  It was a very successful trip.  We had  many conversations afterwards about how to remember and honor human tragedies.  Students created their own memorials in clay and we set up a mini-museum in our art room for the rest of the school to visit.  Students from the class wrote meaning statements to help explain their works of art.  We would like the opportunity to do the same trip. We were surprised that  most of our students had never been out of New York State.  You can imagine their excitement as our bus stopped in front of the White House, the Lincoln Memorial, the Capital building.  They were beaming.\n\nThe Holocaust Memorial Museum is a powerful tool in teaching this history. Even the architecture of the building is evocative.

How much more creative stimulation will they attain to enhance their writing and literacy skills, than they otherwise would by reading one textbook?  \n\n\nThe 130 eigth graders at IS 286 are full of energy and are extremely media savy. They respond well to any kind of multi-media materials used in the classroom. Unfortunately, at our under-resourced Harlem middle school, media equipment is hard to come by. The curriculum has been renamed """"Humanities,"""" combining English and Social Studies. Three of the teachers have joined together to create a true humanities curriculum, but cannot incorporate film, music or art work because of lack of funding. In order to build on the humanities framework and achieve our goals of teaching across disciplines in a creative and exciting way, we would greatly appreciate a TV/VCR and small stereo unit for use in all of our classrooms.  \n\n\nOur students come from highly disadvantaged backgrounds. Over 90% receive free school lunches. They need a dynamic and creative curriculum that will reach them and allow them insights into the world around them in all of its richness and complexity. The curriculum demands the integration of all humanities disciplines (history, literature, art, music, film, etc.) but does not provide for any of the necessary materials that can bring this vision to the classroom. The teachers have already joined together to reform the way our classrooms look and the activities that take place within them. Now all we need is two pieces of media equipment that we would be more than happy to share among us.  \n\n\nWith a TV/VCR unit and a stereo we could carry out our ideas in the classroom and see the humanities curriculum come to life.  \n\n\nA TV/VCR Combo and a stereo, purchased from circuitcity.com, costs $471, including shipping and disposable camera.""",,,,,

The books were on the shelf for less than an hour before they started disappearing, one by one. It was infectious!

These are stories that capture our students' realities, fantasies and most importantly, their undivided attention.\n\nIn seeing their enthusiasm towards reading, I knew that I had to do something to capture the moment, to foster the love of reading.  Students are interested in the books because they are reading about something that is relevant to their lives.

Fortunately, there are twenty students in my class so that I can provide each student with the necessary individualized attention and guidance to help them become more successful students.\n\nThe course is an English Language Arts class with a tremendous focus on life skills such as time management, developing and utilizing coping mechanisms and communicating effectively with one another. \n\nThis course focuses on adolescent issues, exploring the obstacles many of them face while focusing on the solutions that exist. I plan on using the characters and scenarios from the texts as case studies, to allow the students to learn about other teens who have experienced and overcome hardships to become productive adults.

This year I would like to implement a fresh new approach.  Rather than have the kids take notes in their black and white composition notebooks during each lesson, I thought of having each child use a wipe board to follow along with what I am teaching at the board.  This way, there are no torn papers, broken pencil points, pieces of erasers flying in the air, and arguments over whose yellow #2 pencil  belongs to whom.  The children will be using a dry erase board just like me and they will feel more connected to their learning.  It will be a major improvement not only to how they feel towards the lessons each day, but also for classroom management.  I feel the boards will help us focus more clearly on what we are learning rather than on their materials because everyone will be using the same things!  \n\nThe dry erase board in the front of the room will also be used during morning meetings where I write the morning message.  The morning message written on the large dry erase board will tell the students what they will be expecting out of the day.  \n\nClear expectations are very important for children.  If they know what they will be looking forward to, you are already setting a standard for how they should behave for the rest of that day.  Morning messages are also a way for children to improve their literacy skills.  Reading the morning message is the first thing they do so they can utilize their literacy skills and strategies early in the morning.  \n\nThe morning message also includes grammar, spelling, and punctuation mistakes so the children are being challenged and assessed informally so as to practice and improve their skills and this allows me to see who needs help where.  \n\nThese materials will help me make my students feel more connected to their learning and to me.

This is perhaps the most important benefit of this idea.  Thirdly, I can place these Mini-lessons from the digital camera on the internet or computer, so that when a student is absent, he/she can come in the next day, watch the Mini-lesson on a computer with head phones, and essentially be caught up on the skill we learned the previous day. \n\nBy using a digital video camera, I can enhance and vary the type of learning that takes place in the classroom, and hopefully effect change for over 200 students at Roberto Clemente Middle School.\n\n""","""As a 7th grade English Language Arts teacher in a low-income school in Harlem, New York, understanding how my students access information is paramount.

My students just took their practice test for the state CTB test. It was the first time I have seen the test. The math test was entirely word problem based and the reading test was all reading comprehension. I have been working my kids hard and there is never a down moment in my class. However, when I looked at the test and watched my kids take the test I realized how terribly unprepared they were for it and how unprepared they will be unless I change my instruction.\n\n\nWhen I was in the fifth grade I received a vastly different education than my students. We didn't participate in readers workshop, we filled out worksheets. We didn't have conferences with the teacher during writers workshop, we rewrote our papers based on the red marks the teacher made on our drafts. The philosophies of teaching have changed drastically since I was a kid. One thing however I believe must remain constant; vocabulary. I still remember struggling through my """"Wordly Wise"""" book every night when I came home from school. Vocabulary was dreadful I thought at the time but I realize now that it was tremendously important. Based on the books my students have been provided and the structure my school has given to our day however, vocabulary instruction is overlooked. We don't have vocabulary books and my students don't have a good vocabulary as a result.\n\n\nAccording to their CTB scores from last year my students' greatest need of instruction is in “words and phrases in context”. I have watched my students read and when they get to a word they do not know they have no strategy to draw upon to figure it out. They become flustered.

My students just took their practice test for the state CTB test. It was the first time I have seen the test. The math test was entirely word problem based and the reading test was all reading comprehension. I have been working my kids hard and there is never a down moment in my class. However, when I looked at the test and watched my kids take the test I realized how terribly unprepared they were for it and how unprepared they will be unless I change my instruction.\n\n\nWhen I was in the fifth grade I received a vastly different education than my students. We didn't participate in readers workshop, we filled out worksheets. We didn't have conferences with the teacher during writers workshop, we rewrote our papers based on the red marks the teacher made on our drafts. The philosophies of teaching have changed drastically since I was a kid. One thing however I believe must remain constant; vocabulary. I still remember struggling through my """"Wordly Wise"""" book every night when I came home from school. Vocabulary was dreadful I thought at the time but I realize now that it was tremendously important. Based on the books my students have been provided and the structure my school has given to our day however, vocabulary instruction is overlooked. We don't have vocabulary books and my students don't have a good vocabulary as a result.\n\n\nAccording to their CTB scores from last year my students' greatest need of instruction is in “words and phrases in context”. I have watched my students read and when they get to a word they do not know they have no strategy to draw upon to figure it out. They become flustered. Their second greatest need is in understanding the main idea and theme of a text. Reading comprehension goes hand in hand with understanding words. I have designed a word study program in my class that focuses heavily on learning to spell words that are difficult for my children but at this point I need to improve my instruction for their sake.

It's important to me to make this intense literacy instruction personally meaningful to the children.     \n\n\nOne of the most effective ways I have improved my students' interest and confidence in writing is through our """"class news"""". We begin by sharing things that are going on in our lives. The children love this opportunity to talk about the things that are important to them. As the discussion unfolds, I steer it towards an emerging common theme (this is never difficult, once one six-year-old shares how their grandmother died or their tooth fell out then every child wants to share how that happened to them, too).

""","""I am a first grade teacher in an English-only classroom in a dual language school in Sunset Park. Our school has a high percentage of English language learners and students receiving free lunch. Home exposure to reading and writing is often very limited, so there is a lot of pressure on literacy support within the school. It's important to me to make this intense literacy instruction personally meaningful to the children.     \n\n\nOne of the most effective ways I have improved my students' interest and confidence in writing is through our """"class news"""". We begin by sharing things that are going on in our lives. The children love this opportunity to talk about the things that are important to them. As the discussion unfolds, I steer it towards an emerging common theme (this is never difficult, once one six-year-old shares how their grandmother died or their tooth fell out then every child wants to share how that happened to them, too).

I am writing to request a class set of books from the """"Shakespeare for Kids"""" series written by Lois Burdett.\n\n\nEvery year since I began teaching I have completed a Shakespeare Author study with my students, and every year the project becomes bigger and bigger because of the enthusiasm of my students. In my first year of teaching, I simply read the plays aloud to students. I knew the plays were a hit when one day I had forgotten that my students were supposed to have a bit of free time; I picked up """"Romeo and Juliet"""" and began reading. When it was time to go home, they begged me to continue reading. It wasn't until I was walking my students out that I realized it was Friday and I had forgotten to give them free time. I didn't hear one complaint!  \n\n\nIn my second year, I not only read the plays aloud, but we also acted out scenes from the plays, wrote letters to characters giving them advice about their problems, and even wrote news articles about significant events in the plays such as the murder of King Duncan in """"Macbeth"""" or the brawl between the Capulets and Montagues in """"Romeo and Juliet.""""  \n\n\nNow I not only read the plays aloud, but students are so enthusiastic that they take plays out of the public library and read them on their own. Many of my students memorized pages and pages of the plays so that they could participate in a read-a-loud contest, and all of my students had a chance to recite Shakespeare when we put together a class production of """"Macbeth."""" Last year my students also designed their own project, which was to create diaries for the characters, a difficult task since they would have to identify all the significant events in the life of the character and then decide how the character would feel about the situation. In their character diaries, students took on the voice and the language of the characters, and even wrote poems from one character to another.  \n\n\nThe """"Shakespeare for Kids"""" series entices reluctant readers and writers, while also challenging higher learners who are more apt to observe the complexity of the characters and their predicaments. All students begin to acquire, and use in their writing, the vocabulary that recurs throughout all the plays. The motivation to read is there --every time I turn around, I find a student with my Shakespeare book in her hand, and a crowd of students attempting to join in.  \n\n\nThis year my school library received five copies of the """"Shakespeare for Kids"""" plays, and when I went to take """"Hamlet"""" out, I found that all the Shakespeare plays had already been checked out by former students! Whether it's the action-packed plots or the drawings and writing included by kids their own age, my students year after year are drawn to these books.

The articles are challenging, yet the teacher's guide which comes with each magazine issue offers teachers different methods to reach all learners. The vocabulary is difficult, especially for students in my school, the majority of whom are second language learners.  However, I have devised methods of introducing the vocabulary, so that students do not have to struggle with the article.

For example, there is usually a sports article, as well as an interview with children's book authors or child actors.  There is always a Math connection in the form of different graphs on topics of interest to children such as the top five movie money makers. My students look forward to receiving their weekly copy, despite the fact that a new copy means new essay writing, and new problem solving.\n\nI have already begun to provide workshops to fourth grade teachers about strategies for reading and responding to non-fiction in the form of persuasive essays. For example, I took teachers through the process by which I taught an article in Time for Kids entitled, """"The Struggle With Iraq"""". I showed them how I introduced the vocabulary, provided a graphic organizer for students to fill in as they read the article (guided reading), and then showed how students used their organizer to write a persuasive essay about whether or not we should go to war with Iraq. In their essay, students used the information from the article: Bush's opinion, Allies' opinion, and the American people's opinion (according to the article). When they wrote the essay they added an introduction and their own opinion now that they knew other points-of-view.  \n\nEvery student in my class was able to write the essay because the process had been broken down for them. Each wrote at his/her own level, and then I conferenced with the students individually to help students expand on their ideas or even to find more information from the article.  \n\nTeachers show an interest in using Time for Kids, and we as a fourth grade could be stronger if all students had access to the same materials. Furthermore, access to Time For Kids in all fourth grade classrooms would allow other teachers to present their ideas about how to teach non-fiction using the magazine. I know teaching with Time for Kids works, and I want to share my methods with other fourth grade teachers as well as acquire new ideas from my fellow teachers.  \n""","""I am a Teach for America alumna in my fourth year of teaching 4th grade at PS 128M (""""The Audubon School"""") in Washington Heights.

I am writing to thank you for your generous donation to our school. \n\nI have been teaching with TIME for Kids magazines for more than four years. My students love the magazines, and they never complain when I hand them out! More important, they are willing to write essays and letters based on the articles in TIME for Kids because the issues presented in the magazines are issues that my students care about. My students have debated on such diverse topics as whether or not the United States should have gone to war without support from the United Nations to whether or not eighteen-year-olds should be allowed to enter the N.B.A. \n\nI am sure that the other fifth graders in our school will also benefit from TIME for Kids magazines in the classroom, especially now that teachers have the same curriculum materials from which to plan our lessons.\n\nOn behalf of the students, teachers and the administration at PS 128, thank you for your generosity.\n\nSincerely,\nMs. I  """,

Unfortunately, their desire to learn is often limited by the lack of resources characteristic of a marginalized community.  As the teacher of these students, I have vowed to do whatever it takes to keep these students interested in learning.  Arguably, exposure is the most effective way to keep my students interested in learning, as exposure allows my students to witness a world they currently cannot even conceive of.\n\nFortunately, as a teacher in New York City, I can expose my students to a vast variety of experiences only available in New York City.  Unfortunately, one of the greatest experiences in New York City is too great an expenditure for my students.  This experience, for which New York City is credited worldwide, is a trip to a Broadway play.  The benefits of attending a Broadway play are second to none.  From the subway ride to Manhattan to the color performers to the live music, this would prove to be an experience that my students would remember forever; as well as an opportunity to see what life is like outside of the South Bronx.\n\nAs a teacher of mostly English-Language Learners, I had to select a Broadway musical that all of my students would be able to enjoy.  """"The Lion King,"""" with its vivid sounds and movements, lends itself most effectively to my students. """"The Lion King"""" allows us to compare and contrast the movie to the play, a skill that is extremely undeveloped in many of my students.  In addition to comparing and contrasting, we will analyze which form better suited """"The Lion King,"""" and discuss why we think the producers decided to make this Disney film into a musical.  Further written reflections on ethics, family feuds, power, etc. will also follow the show.\n\nThis time at """"The Lion King"""" will paint a permanent picture in my students' minds.  Whether this picture comes out through their writing, their drawings, their conversations, or their thoughts, the ability to activate the imagination is essential to the creation of life-long learners.  This trip will allow my students to witness the joys of New York City they often hear about, but never experience.  This trip will give my students the ability to imagine the unimaginable, and make their dreams a reality.  This trip will allow my students to share in the excitement of a seeing a Broadway show and will forever eliminate the inquiry in my classroom:  """"Broadway, what's Broadway?""""\n""","""Community Elementary School 28, nestled in the heart the Tremont section of the South Bronx, is home to 24 of the most enthusiastic third grade students I have ever taught.  Unfortunately, their desire to learn is often limited by the lack of resources characteristic of a marginalized community.  As the teacher of these students, I have vowed to do whatever it takes to keep these students interested in learning.  Arguably, exposure is the most effective way to keep my students interested in learning, as exposure allows my students to witness a world they currently cannot even conceive of.\n\nFortunately, as a teacher in New York City, I can expose my students to a vast variety of experiences only available in New York City.  Unfortunately, one of the greatest experiences in New York City is too great an expenditure for my students.  This experience, for which New York City is credited worldwide, is a trip to a Broadway play.  The benefits of attending a Broadway play are second to none.  From the subway ride to Manhattan to the color performers to the live music, this would prove to be an experience that my students would remember forever; as well as an opportunity to see what life is like outside of the South Bronx.\n\nAs a teacher of mostly English-Language Learners, I had to select a Broadway musical that all of my students would be able to enjoy.  """"The Lion King,"""" with its vivid sounds and movements, lends itself most effectively to my students. """"The Lion King"""" allows us to compare and contrast the movie to the play, a skill that is extremely undeveloped in many of my students.  In addition to comparing and contrasting, we will analyze which form better suited """"The Lion King,"""" and discuss why we think the producers decided to make this Disney film into a musical.  Further written reflections on ethics, family feuds, power, etc. will also follow the show.\n\nThis time at """"The Lion King"""" will paint a permanent picture in my students' minds.  Whether this picture comes out through their writing, their drawings, their conversations, or their thoughts, the ability to activate the imagination is essential to the creation of life-long learners.  This trip will allow my students to witness the joys of New York City they often hear about, but never experience.  This trip will give my students the ability to imagine the unimaginable, and make their dreams a reality.  This trip will allow my students to share in the excitement of a seeing a Broadway show and will forever eliminate the inquiry in my classroom:  """"Broadway, what's Broadway?""""\n""",,,,,

Please take the time to donate to my students' educations and help make our school truly part of the Silicon Valley. Your gift will not only give the students at my school infinite valuable learning experiences, but will teach them about the kindness of others.\n\nThank you for your time and generosity!""",,,,,

I think that it is a well-known fact that reading is the most important component of learning. Therefore, children who are behind in reading have trouble staying on level in all other areaso f their education. \n \nI am attempting to alleviate this problem by bringing my students up to or above 5th grade reading level, and to instill a love of reading. I am trying to implement a balanced literacy reading and writing workshop in which my students will spend 90 minutes a day working in various stations or centers.  This is one of a series of requests I have written to put this into action.  I have broken the proposal into several pieces to break up the cost of implementation, and hopefully receive some components of this workshop if not others.\n\nThis is the second these proposals. I would like to bring some classic children's literature into my student's lives.  Unfortunately, books that we remember reading at their ages are much too difficult for my students to read.  \n\nPlease fund this proposal so my children can enjoy some classic children's literature without feeling “dumb”. Help them be able to enjoy the story without spending all of their time decoding words.\n\nThank you.\n""",,,,,

There are 24 students in my class. 100% of students in our school qualify for free lunch.\n\nCurrently, my school does not have a working library for the entire school to use. We do, however, all have classroom libraries. Because I used to teach first grade, my classroom library books are not meeting the needs of some of my second grade students, especially those who are above grade level. Often, we as teachers concentrate on those students who are struggling and in need of intervention. While doing so is integral to student achievement, we cannot neglect our other students as a result. Children who are learning to read become better readers by reading books which both interest and challenge them.\n\nI am requesting groups of books for students to use during Guided Reading sessions and for the Lending Library so that students may borrow books to take home and return. The first three books are from the """"Little Bill"""" series, which chronicles the life of an African-American boy. The second three books are from the """"Junie B. Jones"""" series, which follow the life of a young girl. By choosing books that reflect the gender and demographic diversity of our classroom, I am hoping that students will become even more interested and passionate about reading. \n\nBooks would be used, at this point, by about 18 students every day, in Guided Reading, Independent Reading, or Lending Library.

To do this, I would like to set up a listening center.\n\nStudies have shown that read-alouds for children can help them to improve their fluency. With a listening center, I could have some of my students listening to a book while I work with others in the class on other projects. This would be an invaluable tool for my students. They could have correct pronunciation and diction modeled to them while I give individualized writing or reading help. This also would help them to meet the state English standard requiring students to read 25 books each school year.\n\nI currently serve 30 students in my school. The hardest part about my job is that because students are divided by grade rather than ability level, I always have multi-level classes. Their needs are always so varied that it makes it difficult to help each student learn without boring the more advanced students or talking past those less advanced. \n\nMy students are always excited to be able to work in smaller groups with a teacher. They are more on task and less distracted. A listening center would help me give the more individualized instruction my students need.\n\n""",,,,,

We became educators last year through the New York City Teaching Fellows Program, which trains professionals from outside the field of education to fill teacher shortages in low-performing, hard-to-staff public schools.  Coming from the fields of information technology, management consulting, and public health, we left our jobs at Accenture, McKinsey & Company and the United Nations, in an effort to maximize the value of our professional experiences and bring new perspectives and practices to high-need New York City classrooms.  It is in this spirit that we have developed our attached proposal.\n\nIS 162 is located in Bushwick, a low-income neighborhood in central Brooklyn.  The school is home to almost 1,000 middle school students.  Over 80% are Latino, and most come from first-or second-generation families from the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Mexico.  The remainder are of African/Caribbean-American and Asian heritage.  Almost all (99%) students qualify for the city's free lunch program.\n\n\nProject Description:\nWe are proposing a cross-curriculum/inter-disciplinary project spanning Language Arts, Science, Math, Social Studies and Art.   Divided into four quarters, each focusing on a specific academic subject and topic, students will use photography as a vehicle for creative expression and intellectual inquiry.  The topics of the four projects are based on current student-posed question and expressed interests, as well as pertinent community “problems” (ex: asthma).\n\nQuarter 1: Language Arts. Students will write autobiography essays and supplement their writing with photo journal-style pictures.  Photos of the students themselves, their families, friends and pets, (etc.) will be encouraged.\n\nQuarter 2: Science and Math.  Students will investigate the causes of asthma and the high rates of asthma in the Bushwick area.  We will start with class-based data, surveys, graphs (etc.) and then extend to an analysis of Bushwick asthma rates compared to national averages. Students will generate informational reports, data tables, and graphs and supplement them with pictures of sources of asthma, people with asthma, (etc.).\n\nQuarter 3: Social Studies. Students will investigate how the Bushwick community has changed over the past 50 years via inter-generational student-led interviews. The focus will be on interviewing techniques, question development and note taking. Photos of interviewees, as well as key historic locations will be included in interview photo projects.\n\nQuarter 4: Art and Design.  This final stage will focus on the presentation of “best work” from quarters 1-3.  The culminating project will be a presentation to showcase each student's best work.  A community reception will be planned and we will invite parents, teachers, friends, (etc.).   Focus will be on the aesthetic as well as oral presentation skills. \n\nBenefit to Students:\nDue to a history of low test scores, IS 162 is currently under mandate to demonstrate academic improvement.  As a result, the school has added extra instruction in language arts and math and has had to eliminate “non-core” subjects. Our cross-curricular project strives to enable students to rediscover an enthusiasm, affection, and interest in their learning. By bringing “real” issues into the classroom, we aim to empower students to express themselves in words and images.

However, the lack of maps has limited their complete understanding. How can a student learn about Togo without a map?  How can a student understand the distance between Togo and the United States without a large map?  What remains encouraging is that the students are inquisitive and want to understand the dimensions of the Earth, but are tightly bound to textbook maps.  \n\nIn order to address the needs of my students, the next unit will take my students on an adventure around the world.  They will be “traveling” to discover the history, arts, music, and culture of different ethnic communities.  I would like to create a multicultural music library from Putumayo World Music, the World Playground Classroom Kit, acquire small crafts from different countries, and a classroom set of maps, a globe, and a mounting map set.  I believe my students will learn valuable lessons from such an interesting tour around the world—tolerance, multiculturalism, geography, foreign languages and literacy.  This interesting composition of educational materials will meet the needs of all students—those who need to touch, hear, see, or even smell to understand their environment.  This unit will integrate multiculturalism with geography, which adds to the enchantment of learning.\n\nKnowledge does not stop at the shores of the Atlantic or Pacific Oceans—it is a path of understanding our roots and distance heritages.

With globalization effecting the United States, students need to learn about their country and the international community.  As a nation, our children face an every changing community: locally, nationally, and globally.  Understanding the dynamics of our world can be discovered through geography.  Implementing mapping skills in the classroom can advance the content-area skills, spatial awareness skills, and geography skills. However, current political maps and globes are not available for whole class instruction.  This limits the possibility for these children to learn about the world they live in.\n\nI am first year teacher working with a diverse student population at CES 218 in the Bronx.

We are a Title I school located in the South Bronx.  We have a 95% free lunch population and we also see these same children clammering to participate in the free breakfast program every morning.  Considering this, our children are seen as deprived.   \n\nOur community is not very culturally diverse and the children are, therefore, not afforded opportunities to witness and participate in diversity that is necessary to our societal tolerance.  I am seeking to provide my students with well-earned and deserved windows to explore and retain special memories of new experiences.  Since the children and their parents cannot afford to attend trips that would fulfill their need for diversity, I have decided that it is mandatory for me to bring it to them. The small number of children who are able to attend trips will take pictures and bring it back to the classroom and present it to their classmates.  I envision my classroom being filled with constant flashing lights from a digital camera.  I envision the children using the digital camera to capture learning experiences in the classroom.

We are a Title I school located in the South Bronx.  We have a 95% free lunch population and we also see these same children clammering to participate in the free breakfast program every morning.  Considering this, our children are seen as deprived.   \n\nOur community is not very culturally diverse and the children are, therefore, not afforded opportunities to witness and participate in diversity that is necessary to our societal tolerance.  I am seeking to provide my students with well-earned and deserved windows to explore and retain special memories of new experiences.  Since the children and their parents cannot afford to attend trips that would fulfill their need for diversity, I have decided that it is mandatory for me to bring it to them. The small number of children who are able to attend trips will take pictures and bring it back to the classroom and present it to their classmates.  I envision my classroom being filled with constant flashing lights from a digital camera.  I envision the children using the digital camera to capture learning experiences in the classroom.

Throughout the term we explore the history, literature, cultural life, of New York City. We use books, newspapers, magazines, videos, and any other timely material. We've gone on several field trips over the years, to the World Trade Center, the NYC Aquarium, and the Staten Island Ferry. These trips have been especially meaningful because many of my students have never been out of the Bronx. However, the trip that I have dreamed of most, BROADWAY, has always been out of their reach. The prices are so high that 75% of my seniors are graduating without ever having seen a Broadway show. However, this year I have found a solution, and with your help, we can make it a reality.\n\nI recently went to see Russell Simmons 'Def Poetry Jam on Broadway, and I was thrilled and inspired by the artists and their presentations. While this is not a typical Broadway show in the sense of """"Man of La Mancha"""" or """"Les Miserables"""", I think that the students will love the show, and appreciate the symphony of words and ideas presented in this unique Broadway setting.

I am a high school English teacher, currently teaching """"New York, New York"""", a senior elective that I created six years ago.I teach three sections of the class, approximately 95 students. Throughout the term we explore the history, literature, cultural life, of New York City. We use books, newspapers, magazines, videos, and any other timely material. We've gone on several field trips over the years, to the World Trade Center, the NYC Aquarium, and the Staten Island Ferry. These trips have been especially meaningful because many of my students have never been out of the Bronx. However, the trip that I have dreamed of most, BROADWAY, has always been out of their reach. The prices are so high that 75% of my seniors are graduating without ever having seen a Broadway show. However, this year I have found a solution, and with your help, we can make it a reality.\n\nI recently went to see Russell Simmons 'Def Poetry Jam on Broadway, and I was thrilled and inspired by the artists and their presentations. While this is not a typical Broadway show in the sense of """"Man of La Mancha"""" or """"Les Miserables"""", I think that the students will love the show, and appreciate the symphony of words and ideas presented in this unique Broadway setting. We always write and perform poetry in class, and I expect their own writing to expand and improve after seeing the show.\n   \nI have managed to find and organization that arranges theater trips, and they have worked with the show's producers to get us a price of $23.75 for a special matinee on April 16.

That is what we hope to accomplish at the first Arts Fair scheduled for the Julia Richman Education Complex (JREC) on May 8.

The purpose is twofold:  one, to celebrate the arts and their healing and expressive powers; the other, to build a sense of community by having children from the different schools work together on the same project.\n\nWe are currently recruiting artist volunteers who will participate along with building teachers in creating “arts stations”—hands-on activity centers for students to explore arts materials ranging from ceramics to computer graphics to collage and sculpture.  For the entire afternoon and after-school, students from all six schools (five year olds to eighteen year olds) will be able to sample many aspects of the arts.\n\nThe JREC staffs will need to purchase materials for the children to use with the artists. Since we are hoping to provide a wide range of arts activities and are still actively recruiting artists, we do not yet know precisely which materials will be most useful and most needed.  To avoid obtaining materials that will not be useful, we are requesting (gift) certificates that would enable us to obtain the materials we will need for the students to use at each artist's station.  As artists sign up and clarify their """"station,"""" we will use the certificates to purchase materials.

The focus of each academy is on making a large school smaller and more personable to our students.\n\nIn November of 2002 a non-profit organization called F.I.R.S.T. (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) sponsored a competition among all New York City and New York State schools.  Several teachers and I volunteered to participate with the program.  We spent six hours a week guiding the twenty member sixth grade Lego Team.  Using Lego blocks and other elements such as sensors, motors, and gears, team members gained hands-on experience in engineering, design and computer programming.  The Lego Team competed in both the local and state tournament.  As a direct result, the students became even more excited about science; this excitement was brought back to their classrooms.\n\nI envision the Science and Technology Enrichment Program (S.T.E.P.) as a way to provide an informal setting to encourage my students to use their creativity using engineering principles.  Students will be exposed to a hands-on approach to learning valuable science skills and concepts.   S.T.E.P. will provide a wealth of opportunity for students to engage in hands-on problem solving activities, which will get students motivated about science, and more importantly about learning.\n\nThe idea to develop S.T.E.P. for our school came after I saw such a sincere interest in students, parents and teachers wishing to continue this project.  At that time we decided to plan for an after school enrichment program.  We knew that budget constraints put upon our school would allow for little or no funds, however, the commitment has been made.  Teachers and parents will be working together to provide a fun filled, healthy and safe atmosphere for our children.

As a direct result, the students became even more excited about science; this excitement was brought back to their classrooms.\n\nI envision the Science and Technology Enrichment Program (S.T.E.P.) as a way to provide an informal setting to encourage my students to use their creativity using engineering principles.  Students will be exposed to a hands-on approach to learning valuable science skills and concepts.   S.T.E.P. will provide a wealth of opportunity for students to engage in hands-on problem solving activities, which will get students motivated about science, and more importantly about learning.\n\nThe idea to develop S.T.E.P. for our school came after I saw such a sincere interest in students, parents and teachers wishing to continue this project.  At that time we decided to plan for an after school enrichment program.  We knew that budget constraints put upon our school would allow for little or no funds, however, the commitment has been made.  Teachers and parents will be working together to provide a fun filled, healthy and safe atmosphere for our children.   The items we are in need of require a large start-up cost investment, but they are materials that are reusable and long lasting.  We need six (6) Mindstorm for Schools Team Challenge Sets from Pitsco Lego Educational Division.  These sets will allow us to service as many as 30 students in S.T.E.P.\n\nSix Mindstorms for Schools Team Challenge Packs purchased from Pitsco Educational cost [price], including shipping and [fulfillment]\n""",,,,,

Many students live in the homeless shelter behind the school. Despite these factors, reading has changed many of my students' lives. Because many of my students' home lives contain minimal opportunities to develop their literacy skills, it is my job not only to teach them these skills, but to help kids fall in love with reading. This will allow my students to become lifelong readers and learners. One way I would like to do this is to have kids break out into book-talk groups. However, multiple copies of books are necessary to do this project and my classroom lacks these necessary materials.

My 22 scholars have been very excited about learning this year.  I am responsible for their instruction in all content areas.\n\nDuring science this year, our class, along with the other second grade classes has learned a great deal about various types of animals and their life cycles.  Of all the life cycles of our studies, the metamorphosis of the butterfly is the one of the most visually stimulating for young scholars.  I have found a project for Painted Lady butterflies that would enable the children to see this fantastic change first hand and play a part in the stages.\n\nThe process begins with each child filling halfway, a small amount of food into a plastic container.  They would then place tiny larvae gently onto the food and cover the container.  As the larvae begins to feed on the food, they shed their skin and grow several times their original size.  Each will soon climb to the top of the cup, hang down head first and form a chrysalis.  Within the chrysalis, the old body parts of the larvae are undergoing a remarkable transformation to the beautiful parts that will make up the butterfly.  Within 7 – 10 days, each chrysalis should have attached itself to the paper disk under the lids of the containers.  When the chrysalis has formed, the children will transfer the lids into the butterfly pavilion.  Approximately seven to ten days after the chrysalis formation butterflies will begin to emerge.\n\nThe children will be able to feed the butterflies with fresh flowers and sugar water.  After enjoying watching them in the pavilion, the children will go to the school yard and release their butterflies.  Painted ladies live anywhere in North America, so they can be released anywhere.  \n\nThe project will culminate with a grade trip to the Bronx Zoo's Butterfly Zone.\n\nAs spring approaches, I think it would be terrific for our second grade scholars to fully experience the wonder of the butterfly life cycle.  \n\nI would like to propose the purchase of 6 Insect Lore Butterfly Pavilion School kits – one for each second grade class.

We recently restructured our school into four academies so that it may operate in small teams.  The focus of each academy is on making a large school smaller and more personable for our students.\n\nSupplies and resources have been dwindling and are in many cases, not even available.  However, I am fortunate to be staffed with talented dynamic and progressive teachers as well as with a supportive administration.  I am a young enthusiastic teacher who has not allowed the constraints of our school budget to hinder the learning process for my 160 sixth grade students.  Much of my time is spent trying to hunt for cheap inexpensive materials for experiments and demonstrations to be used for my students.   \n\nWe are approaching a time in our life science curriculum that needs to allow students to investigate human/ animal anatomy and various animal habitats.  I want to give my students a unique opportunity of dissecting owl pellets and bird feathers.  I want them to experience a real understanding of the life cycle of different organisms.  Students will learn the stages of the barn owl from fledgling to mating adults.  They will examine how these owls locate and capture their prey and how owl pellets are formed.  Using bird feathers students will learn to become more detailed in their dissections.  They will examine why feathers are so important to birds.  As they examine the feathers, students will discover the intricate series of barbs and barbules that give feathers their shape and purpose of their function.  They will also investigate the various man made pollutants that harm bird populations such as oils and detergents.  \n\n	When I became a teacher I did so because I wanted to excite all children about the world of science using innovative educational techniques, entertaining demonstrations and simple experiments.  I never set out to be a proposal writer, but I have learned that this must be just one of the many hats that I will have to learn to wear if I want to keep with my goal of providing a hands-on, inquiry based curriculum.\n\n	My students and I would like to thank you in advance for your time and consideration.\n\nThe cost of the owl pellets and supplies purchaseed at pelletsinc.com,, is [price], including shipping and [fulfillment].  \n""","""I am a 6th grade life science teacher at I.S. 72.

""","""   As a reading teacher at I.S. 143, an under-resourced school in District 6, I often work with  second language learners within my regular classroom.  Since our community is largely composed of English language learners whose primary language is Spanish, our school's ESL and bilingual services are focused on reaching this population.  As such, bilingual classes are taught in Spanish, and there are no accomodations made for ESL students whose first language is not Spanish.\n   This fall two students whose primary language is Arabic entered our school, and unfortunately there are no systems or resources currently in place to service their needs.  One of these students recently emigrated from Palestine with his family due to the current conflict in his home country.  The other is a Yemini student who has limited proficiency in his own language as a result of a disrupted and extremely limited academic background in his own country.  Both students are above the average age for their class--both are in 7th grade, and one student is 13, one year behind, while the other is 15, nearly three years behind the other students in his class.  They are eager to learn but are extremely frustrated because they require intensive English remediation that is currently not available for them.\n     I lobbied to have these students removed from their first setting, a Spanish bilingual setting in which they were learning more Spanish than English, and as a result they were placed in my 7th grade monolingual homeroom one month ago.  Although both students are making incredible progress as a result of the switch, they still require a program in which they receive more remediation in English.  Since our school only services English language learners in bilingual classes with ESL assistance, they are attending classes with all other regular education students in 7th grade and are receiving virtually no additional assistance.  There is simply no money or teacher available to teach them English or assist them in their classwork.\n     As such, I have researched and found a computer program called Rosetta Stone which teaches students or adults a second language through the use of visual, audio and written venues.  The software utilizes a whole-language approach, and unlike most of the other materials I have found, it is appropriate for 13 and 15 year-old students.  My school has consented to purchase the software, but a computer is needed in my classroom so these students can work individually on the software with a teacher present in the room.  The idea is that while I teach my regular classes,either of the two students can alternately work on the software and can reach me at any time for more assistance if necessary.  This is not the ideal way to teach them English, but in the current sitaution there are no other options.  The students have been struggling for the past few months and are in dire need of an educational program that meets their needs.  \n     Many corporations and individuals have been willing to donate used computers, but older systems don't have the memory or software necessary to run this program.  I have already gone through three donated computers, and after struggling to set them up and load the software the students' and my hopes are shattered when the program won't run correctly.  What is needed is a relatively new computer with an operating system already in place so that we can load the software and go.  It can be a laptop or a desk model, but it does need to have audio and visual capacity so that the program can run properly and the students can truly utilize all elements of the program.  \n     These two students are in an incredibly unique situation.  They are outsiders within our community, both culturally and linguistically, and many teachers and administrators in the school have been unwilling to assist in specializing their educational program.  I sincerely hope that someone will be able to donate a computer for them to use, because otherwise they will continue to sit in classes where they don't understand the language and will either get increasingly frustrated or will merely give up.  It is already March and neither are succeeding academically.  At this age aquiring a second language requires intense practice and instruction, and it is clear that they are not receiving this within their current setting.

This is when the children write stories together or in small groups.  This encourages language development, good writing practices as well as developing their confidence as independent writers.  This lays the foundation for the children as their education progresses.\n\nSo far my class has written numerous Big Books using the interactive writing process.  some of the titles are: Our Classroom Community, We are the Same, We are Different, A Biography of Ezra Jack Keats, Facts About Weather and Our Favorite Characters. We plan on publishing a few more of these big books.\n\nThe problem is we are running out of space to display our books.  We need to have them easily accessible for the 18 children to be able to read and share their books to each other. We would love to have a Big Book Storage Rack to make it easier for the children to display.\n\nBy having this Big Book Rack, my children will be able to go directly to the books independently.  The Big Book Rack will also preserve the books.  It will encourage them to continue to write more interactive books when they see how beautifully the books can be displayed in one place.\n""",,,,,

The children can write and erase as many times as they like during writing development.  Name writing is just the beginning.  For my students, the sky is the limit! Who knows - my class might contain the next Alice Walker, Steven King or Nikki Giovanni.    You know what they say... practice makes perfect!  Care to help?   """,,,,"""Wow!!!\nThank you so much!  It was extremely kind for you to fund our proposal.  My students will be very excited to get their new white boards.  I can't wait to see them practicing on the lines.\nOn behalf of my students, we sincerely appreciate your generosity.\n\nErica D""",

After my students completed their Water Cycle Bracelets they where allowed to keep them.  The students enjoyed this activity so much that they continue to walk around the school with their bracelets.

In addition, class activities take a lot of planning on my part, because I have to go out and purchase supplies for class assignments.  That is why I am requesting ready-made science kits and teachers' guides, as these will help me teach the curriculum through successful, proven activities.

All 17 students in my class would participate in the project, but the first-place prize winner would win admission to the camp (and a week-long transit pass) while the second-place prize winner would win an animal encyclopedia.  I believe this project would engage my entire class in an excellent learning experience, not just the eventual contest winner.  \n\nDuring 5 days of exploration and excitement, a student will: visit the zoo's newest exhibit, Tiger Mountain; explore the zoo's spectacular exhibit, Congo Gorilla Forest; learn ways children can protect animals and habitats; meet live mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates; ride the Bengali Express through Wild Asia; trek through JungleWorld; travel through the Butterfly Zone; take part in the zoo's Behavioral Enrichment Program; and educate zoo visitors at one of our Conservation Stations.\n\nAfter the student spends four days exploring the adaptations, behavior, ecology, and conservation of wild animals, he or she will visit the Children's Zoo and participate in the care and maintenance of some of its Guinea fowl, sheep, goat, pot-bellied pigs, and more. With his or her whirlwind tour complete, the student will have gained a valuable understanding of the important role that children can play in protecting wildlife in the 21st century.\n\nIf realized, this 5-day camp will be an amazing, unforgettable opportunity for one student. Thank you for your generousity.\n""",,,,,

I believe a new format (one card/day, completed as a """"do now"""" when students enter the class) will be much more successful than the all or nothing approach I used last year.  The uses for these """"essential vocab cards"""" are endless: they can be color coded by Unit or by type (person, law, event, etc.), they can be used for """"around the world"""" review games... my list of ideas keeps expanding.

I wanted to know how many of my students had ever gone to a bookstore and bought a book they wanted to read, a book they could put their name in, dog-ear the pages of, take pristine care of or beat up in the process of lugging it everywhere to read. Only three out of twenty-six said yes. \n\nI teach at a Title I high school in Brooklyn, NY. It's a school where students come as sort of a """"last stop"""" if they've been unsuccessful at their previous high schools, a place where they have one last chance to get a high school diploma. Few of the students are self-defined readers, and I'd like to ask for your help in changing that.\n\nWhile I can work and work at providing the students with good books I have access to, there is simply no substitute for being able to buy a book of ones' own. I'd like to do a Reading Workshop unit, something usually limited to middle school classrooms, where each student does work with her/his self-selected book. It is an experience my students need, an experience I am quite sure will change the minds of the """"non-readers"""" in class. \n\nWith your help, I would like to provide each of the students in my two Literacy classes with a $14 gift certificate--enough to buy most trade paperbacks--to a major bookstore (one of which is located just a few blocks from our school).

Assign time on Brainchild to be done at home\n   3. Use it as a form of classroom management with children engaged in meaningful content area material, while I work and/or conference with a child or a group of children.\n\nBrainchild (PLS-1000) is a portable handheld device that looks like a Gameboy and yet offers the core benefits of computer software. Its hallmark feature is the """"explain function"""" that gives the child immediate feedback for every answer selected. The program ultimately allows children to study at their own pace, explains the material, and motivates them to learn.\n\nStudies indicate that when extended learning techniques such as Brainchild software are added to the mix of traditional instruction, significant gains are achieved. I want those significant gains for my children.\n""",,,,,

My children are intimately familiar with the on-going struggle to breathe, as they have experienced numerous hospital visits and have missed school days as a result of asthma.  This spring, my students will be studying breathing, asthma, and air pollution in their community, to find out why asthma rates are so high, and what they can do about the problem.\n\nAs part of this unit, I would like the students to conduct air quality tests for pollutants like carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, ozone, and sulfur dioxide.

Kemba was fortunate because her case was nationally publicized and President Clinton pardoned her.  As part of Kemba's community service she speaks to other young people about how her bad choices landed her in prison for almost 6 years. I personally met Kemba at the Southern Human Rights Organizing Conference last December and asked her to come and present her story to our students.\n\nWe are trying to have a fundraiser to get the funds necessary it will cost to fly her here and arrange accommodations.

By 8th grade, one  would expect fluent readers.  Unfortunately, in the lower performing class, this is often not the case.  Of the hundred and forty or so students I teach, many read with very little comprehension.  They are reluctant to read at all.   It is not surprising that  students who have spent eight years not comprehending class material would be reluctant to read.  But, it is my job to help them see they can and get them to practice, which is the only way they will improve.\n\nResearch shows that the single most effective strategy for improving reading scores is time spent reading.  Listening to someone reading aloud and reading along gives students practice reading, as their eyes are reading the words and experience hearing varied language and vocabulary that they might not always hear.   The best part is, they don't see it as reading, so they don't immediately give up before starting.  They are proud when they complete a book and immediately ask for another.\n\nI already have a few books on tape, but to my delight, I have been read out of house and home.

This year I have seen many thirteen-year-olds totally engrossed in listening, and following along to a book.  Some finishing an entire novel for perhaps the first time.   I am asking for ten audio novels.  I have multiple copies of the books I chose, so the students can follow along, tape players and head phones. \n\nThe Language Arts classes at my school are grouped by ability.  Of the four classes I teach, two are """"higher level"""" and two are comprised of students who have had trouble succeeding in school and in standardized tests.   By 8th grade, one  would expect fluent readers.  Unfortunately, in the lower performing class, this is often not the case.  Of the hundred and forty or so students I teach, many read with very little comprehension.  They are reluctant to read at all.   It is not surprising that  students who have spent eight years not comprehending class material would be reluctant to read.  But, it is my job to help them see they can and get them to practice, which is the only way they will improve.\n\nResearch shows that the single most effective strategy for improving reading scores is time spent reading.  Listening to someone reading aloud and reading along gives students practice reading, as their eyes are reading the words and experience hearing varied language and vocabulary that they might not always hear.   The best part is, they don't see it as reading, so they don't immediately give up before starting.  They are proud when they complete a book and immediately ask for another.\n\nI already have a few books on tape, but to my delight, I have been read out of house and home.  Please help me supply more audio books for my students.\n \n""",,,,,

When I do art projects with my class their eyes light up because they truly enjoy the experience. It is so important that children experience art at an early age so they can learn to appreciate the many forms of creativity.\n""",,,,,

Once they get interested in this part of our program they also fullfill their academic programs as well.

Autism is a condition that can afflict any child regardless of his or her race, religion or socioeconomic group. It occurs in all geographic areas. Autism is manifested in many different ways and there is a spectrum of severity of the disorder.\n\nMany children with Autism have difficulty disseminating sensory input. This can cause an array of behaviors, usually displayed to block out input that is undesirable to the particular child. The children are unable to function without processing these stimuli properly. There are many interventions to help the children to better cope with the vast amount of sensory input that is required every day. Among these interventions is the use of weighted vests, ankle and wrist weights, lap pads, shoe pockets and weighted blankets. These calm the children so that they can become less distractable and less hyperactive. The use of these weights provides for an increase in proprioceptive input. Ideally the weighted vests should be worn for periods of time over the course of the day. With 66 children in need of these vests, we obviously need quite a few to share among the students all day long. With better attending skills the children can focus in on learning the functional activities that will better enable them to become contributing members of society. The goal of all educators should be to encourage independence of the children that they teach.

The children range in age from 4.8 years through 11 years of age. There are currently 66 children in this unit, all with varying degrees of Autism.                               Autism is a condition that can afflict any child regardless of his or her race, religion or socioeconomic group. It occurs in all geographic areas. Autism is manifested in many different ways and there is a spectrum of severity of the disorder.\n\nMany children with Autism have difficulty disseminating sensory input. This can cause an array of behaviors, usually displayed to block out input that is undesirable to the particular child. The children are unable to function without processing these stimuli properly. There are many interventions to help the children to better cope with the vast amount of sensory input that is required every day. Among these interventions is the use of weighted vests, ankle and wrist weights, lap pads, shoe pockets and weighted blankets. These calm the children so that they can become less distractable and less hyperactive. The use of these weights provides for an increase in proprioceptive input.

However, my school does not provide us with tactile materials for non-mathematical areas, so it has been a trial coming up with tactile activities for English lessons.  \n\nI would like to add more hands on activities for this coming September and have discovered a reading manipulatives company that targets many of the reading and grammatical issues my students face every day.  I believe that working with these manipulatives will help build skills related to reading comprehension, sequencing, writing, editing and most importantly, CONFIDENCE.  The text used in the manipulatives are of a high-interest non-fiction variety, which is an added bonus.  These products would help provide a more engaging way for my students to practice vocabulary, word usage and comprehension. \n \nThank you for your consideration and generosity!\n""",,,,,
